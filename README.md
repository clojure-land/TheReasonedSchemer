# The Reasoned Schemer

##### A book by Daniel P. Friedman, William E. Byrd, Oleg Kiselyov

### What is this?

My solutions as I reason through the book. I have read this book in the past. Unfortunately, it didn't really translate into any actionable change to my coding. I *think* I understood the concepts; maybe if I go through more slowly and record my though process I will get more out of it this time.

### What are you using?

I am using [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) to work through this book. There are some [differences](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic/wiki/Differences-from-The-Reasoned-Schemer) between [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) and the version presented in this book (wihch is based upon Scheme).

### Gettting Started
1. You need Clojure installed
2. You need boot

Once you have the above, just cd into this project and execute:
```
> boot repl
```
